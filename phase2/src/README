Welcome to Group 26 Trade System!

Run the main method in GUI.StartGUI to see the GUI version of Group26 trade system!
Run the main method in TradeSystemMain to see the text UI version of the program.

Either way, start by creating an account - either a general user or a demo user.
There is a pre-made admin user in this program, with username-admin and password-admin.
Log in with different types of accounts to enjoy different features of our trade system.

GUI: 2 options were unable to be added to the GUI due to coding/bug issues. Instead, these options were directed into
the console. This includes:
1. User --> Browse items --> create trade
AND
2. User --> Trade --> View/Edit current trades
When you select these 2 options, open the console to continue, once done, go back to the gui to continue.

To edit the thresholds for the server in the text editor, open up the limit.csv file.
- The first number is  limitPerWeek, from the User class. This is the number of trades someone can create per week.
- The second number is the maxIncompleteTrades, from the AdminManager. This is the number of incomplete trades allowed
before the system picks the account out for admins to freeze.
- The third number is tradePrerequisite, from the AdminManager. Not in use at the moment but was supposed to be the
the number of "borrows" a person is allowed before they are unable to borrow and must lend.

The UML diagram are the images in the project.
