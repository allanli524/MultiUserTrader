# MultiUserTrader
Hello! This Multi user trading platform was created with Java and is hosted locally with Swing GUI. My group members and I engineered with project
following the principles of Clean Architecture (eg. by making sure we are separating controller classes from entities etc). We also implemented design patterns 
such as Factory and Iterable patterns for the efficient interaction between over 60 Java classes.

This project was created between myself and 5 other group members in the CSC207 course at UofT over the summer of 2020.
